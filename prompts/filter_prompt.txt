javascript, how to make A-Box with listed items and a filter function with 2 drop down buttons (1st - country(england, germany), 2nd - city((london and portsmouth are only for england), (berlin and collogne are only for germany)). The 2nd drop down filter box only appears when the 1st filter has been choosen.

Every item in the list is actually placed into a seperate flex-container which is inside A-Box. A-Box has limited size, so when there are too many items inside it, it will allow to scroll down, without effecting the rest of the website.
