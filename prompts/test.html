      javascript, how to make A-Box with listed items and a filter function with
      2 drop down buttons (1st - country(england, germany), 2nd - city((london
      and portsmouth are only for england), (berlin and cologne are only for
      germany)). The 2nd drop-down filter box only appears when the 1st filter
      has been chosen. Every item in the list is actually placed into a separate
      flex-container which is inside A-Box. A-Box has limited size, so when
      there are too many items inside it, it will allow scrolling down, without
      affecting the rest of the website. javascript, how to make A-Box with
