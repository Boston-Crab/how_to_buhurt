          HOW BUHURT WORKS?
        </p>
        <p class="align_left text_generic">
          In short, a modern Buhurt is a sport where teams of people fight
          against each other (5vs5, 10vs10, 30vs30..) in full suits of medieval
          plate armor and blunted weapons, until all of one teams fighters falls
          down to the ground, gives up or the opposing team has a considerable
          numerical advantage. The fight lasts until one team wins atleast 2
          rounds.

          SAFETY
        </p>
        <p class="align_left text_generic">
          Modern Buhurt equipment strikes a perfect balance between medieval
          authenticity and modern protection. Medieval hand made armor provides
          a great mobility and protection which is further more enchanced by
          modern shock absorbing fome padding and great spine protection.
          Aswell, every tournament has trained marshals that oversees each fight
          for safety and rules following reasons.
