    HOW BUHURT WORKS?
  </p>
  <p class="text_generic text_first_letter_space">
    In short, modern Buhurt is a sport where teams of people fight against
    each other (5vs5, 10vs10, 30vs30..) in full suits of medieval plate
    armor and blunted weapons, until all of one teams fighters falls down
    to the ground, gives up or the opposing team has a considerable
    numerical advantage. The match lasts until one team wins atleast 2
    rounds.
  </p>

  <p class="text_title margin_bottom_zero text_underline">SAFETY</p>
  <p class="align_left text_generic text_first_letter_space">
    Modern Buhurt equipment strikes a perfect balance between medieval
    authenticity and modern protection. Medieval hand made armor provides
    great mobility and protection, which is further more enchanced by
    modern shock absorbing fome padding and great spine protection.
    Aswell, every tournament has trained marshals who oversee each fight
    for safety and rules following reasons.
